# Occult Crescent Guide

---

## Overview

The Occult Crescent is the new Field Operation for Dawntrail, initially released in Patch 7.25.
The first explorable area is Occult Crescent: South Horn. This area also contains the Forked Tower, a
16-48 player dungeon.

Similar to Bozja, the explorable zones in Occult Crescent will have small encounters as well as
Critical Engagements.

## Phantom Jobs

New to Occult Crescent are Phantom Jobs. Players can equip a Phantom Job to enable them to use
Support Actions and Traits exclusive to that Job, alongside their primary job's actions and abilities.
These Phantom Jobs can be leveled up, allowing players to use additional actions.

## Unlock

The Occult Crescent can be unlocked through the quest "One Last Hurrah" in Tuliyollal (X:17.1 Y:11.8). This quest will give you access
to The Phantom Village, which can be used to access Occult Crescent: South Horn.
